# Operations-Research  
Developed a mathematical optimization model to enhance kidney paired donation programs. Used Python and Gurobi to maximize successful transplants by identifying optimal 2- and 3-way matches, improving fairness, efficiency, and compatibility for donor-recipient pairs in national transplant networks.

# 🧠 Optimizing Kidney Paired Donation Programs  
### 📈 A Mathematical Approach to Maximizing Transplant Success

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Kidney Paired Donation (KPD) is a life-saving solution for patients with incompatible donors. This project presents an optimization-based framework to improve transplant rates by identifying the most effective matches through advanced algorithms. We focused on 2- and 3-way donor-recipient exchanges to maximize successful transplant outcomes in a fair and efficient manner.
